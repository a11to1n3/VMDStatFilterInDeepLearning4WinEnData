# Statistical filtering paper implementation
Created by Duy Anh Pham
## No installation requires. All the blocks of code are implemented on Google Colab (colab.research.google.com)
The reasons of using Google Colab are (1) it is free of charge, (2) it does not require you to install any further libraries to your systems (which is really troublesome sometimes) and (3) it provides 12 consecutive hours of free GPU.

## Note: Detailed description for each forecasting model is written in each *.py fucntion corresponding to the model name.

### Instructions:
1. Go to colab.research.google.com (sign in with your gmail account)
2. Download the **Statistical_filtering_for_deepLearning_documentation.ipynb** file and upload this notebook to your working repository by clicking File - Upload notebook
3. Change runtime: in order to use free GPU on google colab, please go to Runtime - Change runtime type - set Hardware accelerator to GPU
4. Go through the following sections step by step to achieve the results in the paper.

**Tips:** Press Shift + Enter to run each code block!
